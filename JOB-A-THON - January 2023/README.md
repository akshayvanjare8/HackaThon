### Problem Statement


VahanBima is one of the leading insurance companies in India. It provides motor vehicle insurances at best prices with 24/7 claim settlement.  It offers different types of policies for  both personal and commercial vehicles. It has established its brand across different regions in India. 

Around 90% of the businesses today use personalized services. The company wants to launch different personalized experience programs for customers of VahanBima. The personalized experience can be dedicated resources for claim settlement, different kinds of services at doorstep, etc. Inorder to do so, they would like to segment the customers into different tiers based on their customer lifetime value (CLTV).

Inorder to do it, they would like to predict the customer lifetime value based on the activity and interaction of the customer with the platform. So, as a part of this challenge, your task at hand is to build a high performance and interpretable machine learning model to predict the CLTV based on the user and policy data.


### About the Dataset

You are provided with the sample dataset of the company holding the information of customers and policy such as highest qualification of the user, total income earned by a customer in a year, employee status,  policy opted by the user, type of policy and so on and the target variable indicating the total customer lifetime value.


### Data Dictionary

You are provided with 3 files - train.csv, test.csv and sample_submission.csv

Train Set

You are provided with around 90K records containing the attributes of the user and policy and the target variable cltv indicating the total customer lifetime value.

### Submission File Format

The solution file must contain the format similar to that of sample submission. **sample_submission.csv** contains 2 variables - id and cltv. 


|Variable       | Description                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
|id             | Unique identifier of a customer                      |
|cltv           | Customer life time value (Target Variable)           |



### Evaluation metric

The evaluation metric for this hackathon would be r2_score.


### Public and Private Split

Test data is further divided into Public (40%) and Private (60%) data. 

Your initial responses will be checked and scored on the Public data. The final rankings would be based on your private score which will be published once the competition is over.


### Submission Tutorials

All Submissions are to be done at the solution checker tab.
For a step by step view on how to make a submission check the below video

### Guidelines for Final Submission

Please ensure that your final submission includes the following:

1. Solution file containing the predictions for the id in the test set (Format is given in sample_submission.csv)
2. **A zipped file containing code & approach (Note that both code and approach document are mandatory for shortlisting)**
    1. **Code**: Clean code with comments on each part
    2. **Approach**: Please share your approach to solve the problem (doc/ppt/pdf format). It should cover the following topics:
